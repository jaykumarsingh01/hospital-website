      <p>
        Health care, or healthcare, is the improvement of health via the prevention, diagnosis,
        treatment, amelioration or cure of disease, illness, injury, and other physical and mental
        impairments in people. Health care is delivered by health professionals and allied health
        fields. Medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, midwifery, nursing, optometry, audiology, psychology,
        occupational therapy, physical therapy, athletic training, and other health professions all
        constitute health care. The term includes work done in providing primary care, secondary
        care, and tertiary care, as well as in public health.
      </p>
      <p>
        Access to healthcare may vary across countries, communities, and individuals,
         influenced by social and economic conditions as well as health policies.
         Providing health care services means "the timely use of personal health services to achieve 
         the best possible health outcomes".[3] Factors to consider in terms of healthcare access include financial limitations
        (such as insurance coverage), geographical and logistical barriers (such as additional transportation costs and the ability to take paid time off work to use such services), 
        sociocultural expectations, and personal limitations
        (lack of ability to communicate with health care providers, poor health literacy, low income).
        [4] Limitations to health care services affects negatively the use of medical services,
        the efficacy of treatments, and overall outcome (well-being, mortality rates).
      </p>
       
       <h3> DIAGNOSIS</h3>
       <p>  To help frame and organize its work, the committee developed a conceptual model to illustrate the diagnostic
        \ process (see Figure 2-1). The committee concluded that the diagnostic process is a complex, patient-centered,
         collaborative activity that involves information gathering and clinical reasoning with the goal of determining a
          patient's health problem. This process occurs over time, within the context of a larger health care work system
           that influences the diagnostic process (see Box 2-1). The committee's depiction of the diagnostic process 
           draws on an adaptation of a decision-making model that describes the cyclical process of information
         gathering, information integration and interpretation, and forming a working diagnosis
          (Parasuraman et al., 2000; Sarter, 2014)]

          The working diagnosis may be either a list of potential diagnoses 
          (a differential diagnosis) or a single potential diagnosis. Typically,
           clinicians will consider more than one diagnostic hypothesis or possibility a
           s an explanation of the patient's symptoms and will refine this list as further informati
           on is obtained in the diagnostic process. The working diagnosis should be shared with the patient
           , including an explanation of the degree of uncertainty associated with a working diagnosis. Each time there 
           is a revision to the working diagnosis, this information should be communicated to the patient. As the diagnostic
           process proceeds, a fairly broad list of potential diagnoses may be narrowed into fewer potential options, a process
            referred to as diagnostic modification and refinement (Kassirer et al., 2010). As the list becomes narrowed to one or
             two possibilities, diagnostic refinement of the working diagnosis becomes diagnostic verification, in which the lead
             diagnosis is checked for its adequacy in explaining the signs and symptoms, its coherency with the patient's context
              (physiology, risk factors), and whether a single diagnosis is appropriate. When considering invasive or risky diagnostic
               testing or treatment options, the diagnostic verification step is particularly important so that a patient is not exposed 
               to these risks without a reasonable
           chance that the testing or treatment options will be informative and will likely improve patient outcomes.

While the definitions of the various types of health care vary depending on the different
 cultural, political, organizational, and disciplinary perspectives, there appears to be some
  consensus that primary care constitutes the first element of a continuing 
  health care process and may also include the provision of secondary and tertiary levels of care.
  [8] Health care can be defined as either public or private.
  <h4> ABOUT DOCTORS</h4>  
  Becoming a doctor is an enormous commitment because it takes years of dedicated 
  studying and clinical preparation before you can practise as a doctor. As a doctor
  , you interact with patients, diagnose their problems and prescribe medicines to restore
   their physical and mental well-being. If you have a passion for becoming a doctor, understanding 
   this job role can help you make an informed decision. In this article, we answer “What does
    a doctor do?”, explore their average salary, understand their 
  workplace and work environment and learn the qualification and skills required to become a successful doctor.

  People who practise medicine are doctors. Doctors are educated to promote wellness
   and treat illness. The work of a doctor involves numerous aspects. Doctors must
    first determine what is causing a patient's illness. Then they choose a course of
     action. They can also forecast the patient's recovery time.
      Doctors also work to avoid illnesses. Doctors collaborate with a wide range of 
      individuals when treating patients, including nurses, therapists, and physician assistants.



      Doctors are considered the most important and responsible people in society
      . They are the ones who support when someone is struggling with their health
      . Doctors are the ones to have a profound knowledge of all kinds of diseases, thei
      r symptoms, and their treatments. They work day and night selflessly for society’
      s good health. Just like people serving in the army rarely take a break, doctors also are available 
      whenever necessary. Reliability, hard work and sincerity are qualities that every doctor possesses.
       </p>

       <h4> WHAT DOES DOCTOR DO?</h4>
       <p>
        If you are considering a career in health care, you may ask yourself, "What does a doctor do?". Doctors diagnose disease,
         provide treatment, counsel patients with injuries, diseases or illnesses. 
         The specific duties depend upon the speciality you pursue in your MBBS.
          Some doctors work in cardiology, whereas others may work in surgery, neurology, pulmonology 
          or rheumatology. Here are some common duties of a doctor:<br>

<br>

    - listen to patients carefully to understand the disease symptoms<br>
<br>

-perform a diagnosis to find the cause of illness<br>

<br>
 - perform general examination and order blood tests and procedures to understand a patient's ailment or illness<br>

 <br>
 -  provide follow-up treatments or refer patients to other doctors<br>

 <br>
 - collect, record and maintain patient's medical records such as lab test results and other documents<br>

 <br>
 - collaborate with other medical professionals to provide the best patient care<br>

 <br>
 - promote health education in patients<br>

 <br>
 - meet targets set by the government for specific treatments such as adult or child immunisation<br>

 <br>
 - evaluate new drugs and medicines offered by medical representatives<br>

 <br>
  - train resident doctors on various surgery or diagnosis techniques<br>

 <br>
 - say up-to-date with the latest medical technology<br>
<br>

 - convey patient's status to their family members<br>
