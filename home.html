      <h1 style="color: blue;">About Us</h1>
    <p>
      Health care, or healthcare, is the improvement of health via the prevention, diagnosis,
      treatment, amelioration or cure of disease, illness, injury, and other physical and mental
      impairments in people. Health care is delivered by health professionals and allied health
      fields. Medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, midwifery, nursing, optometry, audiology, psychology,
      occupational therapy, physical therapy, athletic training, and other health professions all
      constitute health care. The term includes work done in providing primary care, secondary
      care, and tertiary care, as well as in public health.
    </p>
    <p>
      Access to healthcare may vary across countries, communities, and individuals,
       influenced by social and economic conditions as well as health policies.
       Providing health care services means "the timely use of personal health services to achieve 
       the best possible health outcomes".[3] Factors to consider in terms of healthcare access include financial limitations
      (such as insurance coverage), geographical and logistical barriers (such as additional transportation costs and the ability to take paid time off work to use such services), 
      sociocultural expectations, and personal limitations
      (lack of ability to communicate with health care providers, poor health literacy, low income).
      [4] Limitations to health care services affects negatively the use of medical services,
      the efficacy of treatments, and overall outcome (well-being, mortality rates).
    </p>
     
     <h3>OVERVIEW DIAGNOSIS PROCESS </h3>
     <p> To help frame and organize its work, the committee developed a conceptual model to illustrate the diagnostic
      \ process (see Figure 2-1). The committee concluded that the diagnostic process is a complex, patient-centered,
       collaborative activity that involves information gathering and clinical reasoning with the goal of determining a
        patient's health problem. This process occurs over time, within the context of a larger health care work system
         that influences the diagnostic process (see Box 2-1). The committee's depiction of the diagnostic process 
         draws on an adaptation of a decision-making model that describes the cyclical process of information
       gathering, information integration and interpretation, and forming a working diagnosis
        (Parasuraman et al., 2000; Sarter, 2014).

While the definitions of the various types of health care vary depending on the different
cultural, political, organizational, and disciplinary perspectives, there appears to be some
consensus that primary care constitutes the first element of a continuing 
health care process and may also include the provision of secondary and tertiary levels of care.
[8] Health care can be defined as either public or private.
<h4> ABOUT DOCTORS</h4>

People who practise medicine are doctors. Doctors are educated to promote wellness
 and treat illness. The work of a doctor involves numerous aspects. Doctors must
  first determine what is causing a patient's illness. Then they choose a course of
   action. They can also forecast the patient's recovery time.
    Doctors also work to avoid illnesses. Doctors collaborate with a wide range of 
    individuals when treating patients, including nurses, therapists, and physician assistants.



    Doctors are considered the most important and responsible people in society
    . They are the ones who support when someone is struggling with their health
    . Doctors are the ones to have a profound knowledge of all kinds of diseases, thei
    r symptoms, and their treatments. They work day and night selflessly for society’
    s good health. Just like people serving in the army rarely take a break, doctors also are available 
    whenever necessary. Reliability, hard work and sincerity are qualities that every doctor possesses.
